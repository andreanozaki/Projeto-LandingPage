## 💡 About 

### Elite Cakes 🍰 

A professional-looking sales webpage for online pastry courses. Throughout the project, I implemented advanced HTML and CSS techniques, including the creation of responsive layouts using flexbox and CSS Grid. Additionally, I incorporated modern design practices to ensure an attractive and intuitive user interface.
